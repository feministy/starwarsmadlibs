#### Star Wars! Mad Libs!

Two of my favorite things!

This is a really stupidly simple JavaScript app that takes user input in the form of prompts and spits it back out in the same manner as the introductory credits in *Star Wars*.

The goal of this project was to improve my understanding of how to create an object literal and a constructor function, and what the difference was between the two. There aren't nearly as many constructors as there are literals, but I definitely have a stronger grasp of the concepts.

Yay for *Star Wars*!
